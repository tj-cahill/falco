VYou land your ship behind a sand dune, a short trek away from the laboratory. The sun was setting as you entered this planet's atmosphere, but it's still bright down here on the surface, where the shock-white sand holds its own glow. Sand is all you can see \u2013 without your team's coordinates, you would never have located the laboratory in the middle of this empty, forbidding desert. \u000a\u000aThis laboratory is one of several outposts built by the terrorist organization K.A.L. They appear to be using this location for storage of their most dangerous specimens, including the one you were sent to retrieve \u2013 the Chorobi prototype. The Chorobi is a swarm of microscopic nanobots, machines so tiny that they can infiltrate any system without detection, including human bodies. Your team didn't give you the full details on what K.A.L. coded the nanobots to do, but based on K.A.L.'s past crimes, you can guess the outcome.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, K.A.L. released a self-replicating bacteria into the oceans of New Earth that destroyed the marine ecosystems and triggered a planet-wide environmental collapse. All of New Earth's inhabitants, including you and your family, were forced to abandon their ruined home. That's when you decided to join your current team, with the hope of one day tracking down K.A.L. and confronting them for their crimes.\u000a\u000aThis is <i>almost</i> that mission.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Setup.2]]</div>

VUnfortunately, your team ordered you to break in silently and complete the mission unnoticed. Your sole task is to retrieve the Chorobi prototype, nothing else. You spent the ride here reminding yourself of that and trying to clear your mind. Now that you've landed, you operate on autopilot, suiting up and grabbing your gear the same way you do for every mission.\u000a\u000aBy the time you exit your ship, the sky is black and starless, although the sand still glows faintly underfoot as you head around the dune and approach the K.A.L. laboratory. It's a stark and ugly building \u2013 <i>not that I expected much else</i>, you think. The concrete square of a building backs into a rocky outcropping, probably to protect it from the planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aAs you approach, you scan the laboratory for entry points. Of course, you could enter through the front door, a massive metal contraption sealed shut by a security panel. Your team sent some old K.A.L. password to your decoder device, so you should be able to hack through the front door. \u000a\u000aAlternatively, you could head around the side of the building, where you know there's a large hangar door for vehicles to deliver shipments under the protection of the outcropping. As long as there's no vehicle present, it should be easy to slip in. Or you could climb up to the roof and look for a sneakier way in, like a maintenance entrance that drops into the building.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[front door|Choice1A][$choice1 to "1A"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[hangar door|Choice1B][$choice1 to "1B"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[roof|Choice1C][$choice1 to "1C"]].</li>\u000a</ul>

VYou decide to enter through the hangar.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, you easily identify the huge hangar door. It extends halfway up the building, but right now the door is partially closed, only tall enough to admit trucks and other commercial vehicles. One such truck is sitting in the hangar bay with its rear doors open and half of its shipment unpacked. You duck inside the far end of the hangar and wedge yourself behind a work bench to observe the situation.\u000a\u000aAs you expected, you soon witness movement \u2013 a laborer trundles back to the truck, drags out another box, and carries it off to a storage room. You wait for one more cycle of delivery before you feel confident that you have enough time to move unnoticed. \u000a\u000aThe next time the laborer leaves with a box, you follow, creeping around benches and shelves and vehicle parts to get to the far wall of the hangar. You scan the wall and its many doors, all labeled with unhelpful identifiers like A-42 and D-16. Guess we're leaving it to chance, you tell yourself, and yank open the nearest door.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the hall appears empty. You don't test your luck by lingering; you dart down the hall and into the next one, hunting for a hiding spot. Right on time, you sight an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As you suspected, the door is unlocked, so you push it open and peek inside.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1B.2]]</div>

VYou decide to enter through the roof.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the laboratory, you unhook your grapple-gun from your belt and aim it at the ledge. <i>Click\u2014zing!</i> The hook sings through the air, clatters onto the roof, and catches the edge with a solid clunk. You give the hook a little tug to make sure it's secure and then click your gun again to reel in the slack. Once the wire is taut, you clamber up the building, hoist yourself over the top, and hop onto the roof.\u000a\u000aYou hold still for a second, hidden in a crouch at the edge of the roof. There's a surprising amount of movement here, although none of it, as far as you can tell, from living things. Thick pillars of steam billow out of exhaust vents, and something past them is spinning, flashing dimly in the night. As you pick your way through the steam, you realize that it is several somethings \u2013 a half dozen wind turbines mounted to the far end of the roof.\u000a\u000aThe turbines are small, not much taller than yourself, and each is wired to a large battery box that sits behind it. In the relative calm of dusk, only a couple of the turbines are rotating; the rest stand still, nothing more than strange white stalks growing out of the concrete. During the daytime, the turbines must generate a significant amount of energy for K.A.L. \u2013 and you can only imagine how much energy is produced during one of this planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aYou crouch down to examine one of the battery boxes. Unclipping a multitool from your belt, you unscrew the box lid and throw it open. As expected, a familiar tangle of wires greets you. Your training included basic electrician work to cover situations like this. Opening the battery box only confirmed that it would be easy for you to sabotage this energy system, if you decided to do so.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1C.2]]</div>

VYou decide to enter through the front door.\u000a\u000aAfter all, your team provided you with a security code. <i>Might as well use it and reward their hard work</i>, you think. After jogging up to the front wall of the laboratory, you unclip your decoder from your belt and attach the little box to the door's security panel. The box whirs to life, its display flickering with a blur of numbers too fast for you to read. All you care about is the progress bar at the bottom, which fades from red to yellow to green. \u000a\u000aA small <i>ding</i> from the decoder is answered by a <i>clunk</i> within the door. The door's locking mechanisms groan and grind against each other as they twist open, and finally the two halves of the door shudder apart to grant you entrance. You wonder if it takes this much effort for the door to open every time. It sounds like it hasn't been used in weeks, so it's possible that the staff use a smaller entrance that your team doesn't know about.\u000a\u000aEither way, you're inside. The sheer metal walls and corrugated floor resemble every other scientific facility you've been in. You don't see any cameras or sensors in the front hall, but you hurry around the corner anyway.\u000a\u000aYou're looking for a room to duck into and plan your next move \u2013 and right on time, you sight an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As you suspected, the door is unlocked, so you push it open and peek inside. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1A.2]]</div>

VThe room contains some metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from the floor when you opened the door.\u000a\u000aYou duck inside and shut the door behind you. So far, so good \u2013 no alarm means that it's unlikely you were caught on a hidden sensor. You take a minute to deactivate your decoder and secure it on your belt again; then you're ready to explore the building. You press your ear to the door to verify that nothing has changed since you stepped in. Sounds clear, so you push it open and head out.\u000a\u000aYou're not two steps into the hall before you hear voices from around the corner \u2013 K.A.L. staff!

VThe small chance that you might get decent information isn't worth the time.\u000a\u000aYou leave the room behind and scamper down the hall, concentrated on getting out of sight as soon as possible. You round the corner and plant your back against the wall. At first, it sounds like you're all clear: the staff has carried on with their chitchat, ignorant of your presence.\u000a\u000aBut as you creep down the hall, your ears catch onto bad news. The staff's voices have only grown louder, their footsteps closer. They must have turned down the hall you just left. You quickly scan your surroundings for anything of use, but the hall stretches mercilessly long and devoid of doors. \u000a\u000a<i>No choice but to run</i>, you decide. The noise might attract some attention, but the sight of you will attract more. So you scamper down the hall, trying your best to land on the balls of your feet. Your feet still slap painfully loudly against the metal, and as soon as you get around the corner, you pull yourself to a halt.\u000a\u000aTo your right, you can hear an even louder commotion than what you just made. A glimpse of open double doors suggests a lounge or cafeteria, thick with chattering people. You avoid that and turn left. \u000a\u000aYou don't have an exact sense of where to go, but you suspect that the staff might have exited the inner lab just before you encountered them. Betting on that, you do your best to make a loop of the halls and circle back to the direction that the staff came from. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2B.2]]</div>

VThe chance to get information is worth the risk. \u000a\u000aYou duck into the storage room, leaving the door cracked, and hide yourself in a corner. If someone checks this room, you won't be concealed from sight, but you should have enough time for a surprise attack.\u000a\u000aThankfully, it doesn't sound like that will be necessary. Judging by the staff's footsteps, they haven't turned down this hall. There are about three of them, gossiping about the new security system installed in the inner laboratory.\u000a\u000aOne of them whines, "They couldn't have installed a slower unlock sequence on that door. I swear that even the buttons lag when you try to enter the code."\u000a\u000aMinor complaints aside, the group consensus is that the new system have been an improvement. The voices start to fade out of your hearing, so you creep closer to the door and ease it open to catch some last comments. It seemed like your patience was not rewarded with any valuable information, until \u2013 \u000a\u000a"And they finally fixed the Glacior!" one of them says.\u000a\u000aYou aren't overly familiar with Glacior technology, but you remember it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.\u000a\u000aThe staff member continues: "Every time I removed a prototype without the deep freeze, it felt like I was risking my life."\u000a\u000aThe others laugh, but say, "You <i>were</i>."\u000a\u000aFinally some decent information: low temperatures make the nanobots safer to handle. You wait until the staff's footsteps have faded, and then exit the room and proceed down the hall. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2A.2]]</div>

If a turbine malfunction immediately summoned a technician to the roof, your mission would be just as immediately compromised.\u000a\u000aAfter all, your team was very clear about your orders: acquire the Chorobi prototype, unnoticed and as quickly as possible. But they couldn't have anticipated this perfect opportunity to cripple K.A.L.'s work. \u000a\u000aWhat if the turbines powered the inner laboratory itself, where K.A.L. stores their specimens? A power outage could spoil or damage their carefully-preserved specimens, which would be as dangerous as it is satisfying to you personally. Then again, the turbines could generate nothing but backup power, in which case damaging them would be nothing but an annoyance to K.A.L.\u000a\u000aYou rise to your feet, scan the roof again, and consider your options.

VYou decide that it's worth the risk \u2013 as long as you do it fast.\u000a\u000aWith more time, you would love to dismantle the turbines, strip off the blades, strip the screws, toss the pieces into the sand, and let the desert wind bear them away. As it is, time constrains you to a more utilitarian and less dramatic approach.\u000a\u000aYou target the wired connection between the turbines and batteries. Flipping your multitool to its bladed function, you saw through the rubber hose protecting the wires and then snip, snip, snip. Even for six turbines, the process doesn't take more than a couple minutes total \u2013 and more importantly, you don't notice any sparks or alarms during that time. \u000a\u000aThe roof remains silent and empty. The turbines' blades continue to spin mildly in the breeze, unaware that they've been stripped of their purpose in life.\u000a\u000aAfter severing the connections, you follow the wires from the battery boxes back to their source, a central generator. As you'd hoped, the generator sits conveniently near a maintenance hatch. You wrench the hatch open and hop into the laboratory. \u000a\u000aThe hatch dumps you into what looks like a storage room \u2013 metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from when you pulled open the hatch. You reach up and yank the hatch shut after you, wincing at the resulting <i>clonk</i>. \u000a\u000aBut a peek outside the storage room indicates that no one was around to hear the noise.

VYou can't risk the mission for the sake of your own personal satisfaction.\u000a\u000aYou leave the turbines as they are \u2013 although they might still be useful to you in one way. If there is a maintenance hatch on the roof, it should be near the most important machine up here. You inspect the battery boxes again and find the wires trailing away from the boxes, toward a central generator. Exactly the map you need.\u000a\u000aThe wires lead you directly to the generator. As it turns out, you could have found the generator while stumbling around blind because of the incredible amount of noise rattling off the thing. The generator is a brute of a machine, a massive shuddering mechanical engine block that's entirely out of place among the slender turbines and their neat lines of wires. \u000a\u000aSquinting through the noise, you circle the generator to locate your prize \u2013 a maintenance hatch, which you wrench open at once, desperate to escape the clamor. You glance through the hatch only briefly; it's enough to see that the room below is dark, and probably unoccupied. \u000a\u000aThen you hop down, landing with a clatter on a metal shelf. Dust glimmers in the air around you, stirred up by the hatch. You've landed in what looks like a storage room \u2013 more metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner.

VYou don't have an exact sense of where to go, so you head in roughly the same direction that the staff came from. You're hoping that they exited the inner lab just before you encountered them. The environment supports your hunch: at the next intersection, the hall to your right has blue directional lights installed into the ceiling. You've seen similar lights in other facilities, where they served as part of a safety system that directed staff to a secure quarantine location in the case of a laboratory accident.\u000a\u000aFocused on the lights, you proceed down the hall and turn the next corner without checking it \u2013 and of all corners, this was the wrong one to take blind. In the middle of the hall stands a hulking, armored Bovem. A local alien species, Bovem tower over humans in both height and weight, and their thick leathery skin, as grey and wrinkled as an elephant's, makes them ideal for guard duty. And much like elephants, Bovem are far from stupid.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem doesn't seem to have noticed you yet. It is stationed in front of a sealed door, its attention fixed on the wall opposite \u2013 or so you assume. Its full-face helmet prevents you from knowing exactly where it's looking.\u000a\u000aYou pause, deliberating on the best course action. Even with their natural armor, Bovem can be stunned and taken down, especially with the advantage of a surprise attack. You wouldn't mind injuring at least K.A.L. employee before you leave here \u2013 but if you misjudge this and the Bovem wins the fight, you'll almost certainly be taken prisoner.\u000a\u000aAnd the guard might be a local forced to work for K.A.L. Maybe you should try to trick it instead, convince it that you're an employee too, a technician with all your gadgets hanging off your belt. Or you could sneak away, hoping that the Bovem doesn't notice the movement, and try to find a less dangerous route to the inner lab.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Attack|Choice3A][$choice3 to "3A"]] the guard.</li>\u000a<li>[[Trick|Choice3B][$choice3 to "3B"]] the guard.</li>\u000a<li>[[Sneak away|Choice3C][$choice3 to "3C"]] from the guard.</li>\u000a</ul>

VYou decide to take advantage of the element of surprise and attack the guard.\u000a\u000aYou unsnap the stun gun from your belt and fire at full blast. A bolt of electricity surges down the hall, and for a moment, everything is painted with a blinding white light. Then the bolt hits the guard squarely in its armor. Your bullets and knives wouldn't have been able to cut through thick Bovem skin, but the electric bolt should affect the metal helmet and armor.\u000a\u000aKey word: <i>should</i>. Instead of scorching the armor and disabling its system, the electricity hits the guard, knocks it back one step, and does absolutely nothing else.\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem howls, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio. Instantly the blue ceiling lights flash to red, and unseen speakers shriek a high-pitched alarm. You sprint past the guard, who swipes at you \u2013 too slow \u2013 and shouts your escape route into the radio. \u000a\u000aYou skid around the corner and down the next hall. The overhead alarm is screeching so loudly that you almost miss the <i>thump-thump</i> of guards running in from your left. You scramble right just in time, around another corner, and reach a dead end.\u000a\u000aBut it's the <i>correct</i> dead end. A massive sheer steel wall, studded with thick-glassed viewing windows, stands between you and the inner laboratory. Beneath each window is a small grate to vent fumes, and centered in the middle of the wall is a hefty door and keypad.\u000a\u000aWith the guards storming down the hall behind you, you don't have much time to deliberate.

VYou decide that the simplest approach is to act like you belong here.\u000a\u000aRelaxing your shoulders, you stroll down the hall without paying the Bovem any mind. When it startles and orders you to halt, you look at the Bovem with mild surprise.\u000a\u000a"For what? Isn't this Sector C?" you say, remembering a sign painted on the wall a couple halls back. "I was told to go over to C and check on the filtration system."\u000a\u000aSlowly the guard looks you over, its attention lingering at your belt full of gadgets. You open your mouth to convince the guard that this is a welding gun, not anything else, but it speaks first.\u000a\u000a"Told by who?"\u000a\u000a"My boss."\u000a\u000a"By," the guard growls, "who?"\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aAt your hesitation, the Bovem yells, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio.

VYou decide that the best route is the safest one.\u000a\u000aYou creep back a step, and then another, slipping around the corner and retreating the way you came. The Bovem doesn't follow, so you take a second to breathe and reassess your plans. But not a moment later, a noisy group of K.A.L. employees come ambling out of <<if $choice2 is '2D'>>the cafeteria down the hall<<else>>a room down the hall<</if>>. They're chatting to each other, oblivious to you for now \u2013 but you take the hint and leave the area.\u000a\u000aThe only available escape route leads you directly into a dead end, a small curved chamber with floor-to-ceiling windows of reinforced glass. More importantly, the chamber includes a large grate at foot level. It looks like it connects to a ventilation system that runs beneath the floor panels \u2013 and that is exactly what you need to get out of K.A.L.'s sight for awhile.\u000a\u000aYou switch on the magnetic pulse in the soles of your boots and set the charge to repel. With the magnet's added force, you kick at the grate and the metal flies backward without resistance, clattering down the tunnel it used to protect. Before anyone can investigate the noise, you slip through the hole and out of sight.\u000a\u000aYou drag yourself through the tight quarters of the ventilation crawlspace, digging your toes into the corrugated metal to propel yourself forward. You pass through a sweltering, pitch-black section \u2013 <i>must be crossing through a wall</i>, you guess \u2013 and, on the other side, find yourself beneath a floor panel. Heavy feet clatter overhead; the panel vibrates dangerously close to your face, but steadies out as the footsteps fade away.\u000a\u000aIn the following silence, you roll over, push at the floor panel, and lift it out of place. Another empty hall \u2013 perfect. You scamper out of the crawlspace and shift the panel back into place. \u000a\u000aBrushing bits of dust and grime off your shoulders, you come around a corner and meet with another dead end \u2013 but this one is the correct dead end. A massive sheer steel wall, studded with thick-glassed viewing windows, is all that stands between you and the inner laboratory. Beneath each window is a small grate to vent fumes, and centered in the middle of the wall is a hefty door and keypad.\u000a\u000aYou see two equally good entry points. You could hack through the door, which will take a little extra time, or you could crawl through another tight vent to enter the lab.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Hack through the door.|Choice4D][$choice4 to "4D"]]</li>\u000a<li>[[Crawl through a vent.|Choice4E][$choice4 to "4E"]]</li>\u000a</ul>

You have faith in the decoder's ability to do the hack, but you need to buy it some time.\u000a\u000aYou whip out your stun gun and take wild shots down the hall, trying to bounce the electric shots off the wall and around the corner at the horde of approaching guards. Between sizzles of electric shots, you hear a soft ding from the decoder \u2013 door unlocked.\u000a\u000aYou snatch the decoder off the wall and back through the opening door. Once inside, the first thing you do is hit the button to close and relock the door. Then you reattach your gadgets to your belt and quickly take stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers. Various machines and tools are dotted across the stations \u2013 microscopes, spectrometers, and dozens of others whose names you don't know. \u000a\u000aTwo massive machines dominate the center of the room.

VYou head to the back of the lab. The back wall resembles an aisle of a server room, with rows and rows of narrow black boxes monitored by blinking blue lights. Searching every storage unit for the Chorobi prototype would be impossible, but you realize your task is much simpler.\u000a\u000aA portion of the wall is recessed: it hosts three tall pods filled with a gelatinous yellow liquid. Inside each, suspended safely in the gel, floats a vial no larger than your hand. You have no proof that one of these holds the prototype; at the same time, you have absolutely no doubts.\u000a\u000aYou rush to the computer console set below the pods. At your touch, the screen comes to life and immediately confirms your hunch: Pod #1, Chorobi. The screen also provides an overwhelming amount of details \u2013 the pod's current temperature, acidity, viscosity \u2013 none of which you have time to read. Tapping on the icon for Pod #1 supplies you with a dizzyingly long list of command options.\u000a\u000aYou have to decide now whether you'll take the time to sort through the computer commands or risk smashing the pod to grab the prototype right away.\u000a<ul>\u000a<<if $choice2 is "2A">><li>[[Remove|Choice5F][$choice5 to "5F"]] the prototype through the computer.</li>\u000a\u005c<<else>><li>[[Remove|Choice5A][$choice5 to "5A"]] the prototype through the computer.</li><</if>>\u000a<li>[[Smash|Choice5B][$choice5 to "5B"]] the pod to get the prototype.</li>\u000a</ul>

VWith the guards closing in on you, there's no time to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aYou abandon the computer console and ready your stun gun. You fire one shot at the pod \u2013 thankfully, you fired it from an angle, because the bolt reflects off the glass and strikes a random counter rather than hitting you full in the chest. Forget the gun; you pull out your grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, you rear back with the grappling hook and give the pod a vicious swing. The hook pierces the pod like an ice pick. Instantly the glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods. And just in time \u2013 the guards have unlocked the lab door. You don't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room now, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aYellow gel slops out of the ruined pod, and the vial with it. You pluck it out just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside you.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders. That explains why you haven't been incapacitated already.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5B.2]]</div>

Without reading the rest of the line, you hit that command.\u000a\u000aThe screen bleeps angrily at you and blinks white before displaying an error message: <i>Initial unlock preparations not detected</i>. Before you can panic, it generates another line of text: <i>Override sequence?</i>\u000a\u000aThat's more like it. You tap rapidly on the affirmative option and glance over your shoulder at the worsening situation behind you. The guards have unlocked the lab door and started to enter, wary, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aWhen you look back at the screen, the display has changed. Where you were tapping, there is now the record of a fingerprint scan \u2013 <i>my fingerprint</i>, you realize \u2013 and the rest of the screen has dimmed to a dark red. You can barely read the black text that informs you that the override sequence has been triggered by unverified personnel. \u000a\u000aThe pod rattles unhappily; you switch your attention to it. Despite your lack of verification, a release button has appeared at the base of the Chorobi pod. You slam the button, and the glass exterior of the pod hisses and sinks into the base. Yellow gel floods out of the container \u2013 and the vial with it \u2013 but you manage to snag the vial out of the goo just before it hits the floor.\u000a\u000aJust in time.

VStriding over glass shards, you head to the back of the lab. The back wall resembles an aisle of a server room, with rows and rows of narrow black boxes monitored by blinking blue lights. Searching every storage unit for the Chorobi prototype would be impossible, but you realize your task is much simpler.\u000a\u000aA portion of the wall is recessed: it hosts three tall pods filled with a gelatinous yellow liquid. Inside each, suspended safely in the gel, floats a vial no larger than your hand. You have no proof that one of these holds the prototype; at the same time, you have absolutely no doubts.\u000a\u000aYou rush to the computer console set below the pods. At your touch, the screen comes to life and immediately confirms your hunch: Pod #1, Chorobi. The screen also provides an overwhelming amount of details \u2013 the pod's current temperature, acidity, viscosity \u2013 none of which you have time to read. Tapping on the icon for Pod #1 supplies you with a dizzyingly long list of command options.\u000a\u000aAs you try to skim the list, you hear the remnants of the window shatter under the force of the guards' weapons. The head guard is barking commands, ordering the others to enter the lab through the destroyed window. In hindsight, leaving the guards an easy entrance might not have been the best approach.\u000a\u000aYou only have a second to decide what to do: you can take the time to sort through the computer commands, risk smashing the pod to grab the prototype right away, or fire at the guards to drive them back and give yourself more time.\u000a<ul>\u000a<<if $choice2 is "2A">><li>[[Remove|Choice5F][$choice5 to "5F"]] the prototype through the computer.</li>\u000a\u005c<<else>><li>[[Remove|Choice5A][$choice5 to "5A"]] the prototype through the computer.</li><</if>>\u000a<li>[[Smash|Choice5B][$choice5 to "5B"]] the pod to get the prototype.</li>\u000a<li>[[Fire|Choice5C][$choice5 to "5C"]] at the guards.</li>\u000a</ul>

VYou have enough time to do this properly.\u000a\u000aYou skim through the list of commands, hunting for an <i>unlock</i> or <i>release</i> function. Near the bottom of the list, you notice one that looks promising \u2013 <i>Release sequence AA-18R with hyperaria support</i> \u2013 but before you can tap it, a different command catches your eye.\u000a\u000a<i>Initiate Glacior sequence</i>. Wasn't that the deep-freeze process that the scientist mentioned in the hallway?\u000a\u000aYou hit the Glacior command. Inside the pod, the yellow liquid crackles and begins to crystallize, millions of little ice particles spider-webbing through the container. As ice fogs the pod, the yellow gel desaturates, its color fading to a dim ivory. Finally the pod exhales a chilly puff of fog and, with a ding, the computer announces that the vial is now ready for release.\u000a\u000aYou hit the release button at the base of the Chorobi pod. The glass shield hisses and sinks into the base to reveal a pillar of frozen gel. You try to pry the vial out of the pillar, but even through gloves, the frozen gel bites at your fingers. You unclip the grappling hook from your belt and use one of the barbs to carefully scrape the gel away, sending little flakes of ivory fluttering to the floor.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5G.2]]</div>

VYou skim the long list of commands and notice the word <i>Release</i> near the bottom. The rest of the line is unintelligible to you \u2013 <i>Release sequence AA-18R with hyperaria support</i> \u2013 but you don't see any other options that look better. Hoping for the best, you hit the release command.\u000a\u000aThe screen bleeps angrily at you and blinks white before displaying an error message: <i>Initial unlock preparations not detected</i>. Does that mean you need to find this 'hyperaria support' before the pod will open? \u000a\u000aBefore you can test your theory, the screen generates another line of text: <i>Override sequence?</i>\u000a\u000aThat's more like it. You tap on the affirmative option and watch the screen... do nothing. You tap again, and a third time, with a glance over your shoulder to make sure you're still alone in the lab. \u000a\u000aWhen you look back at the screen, the display has changed. Where you were tapping, there is now the record of a fingerprint scan \u2013 <i>my fingerprint</i>, you realize. The rest of the screen has dimmed to a dark red. You can barely read the black text that informs you that the override sequence has been triggered by unverified personnel. \u000a\u000aThat's when the sirens go off.\u000a\u000aWhirling red lights flash on the ceiling, spinning the room into a crimson mess, and a shrill alarm screams the presence of an intruder.

VYou want to get the prototype and leave, as quickly as possible.\u000a\u000aYou evaluate the Chorobi pod again. The glass exterior of the pod looks as thick as the laboratory windows. Not ideal to break through, but you don't see any weaker points to exploit. Circling to the side of the pod, you pull out your stun gun and fire a test shot at the glass. \u000a\u000aFiring from an angle was the right choice \u2013 the bolt bounces off the glass and flies into a nearby counter. The metal counter crackles with energy, and you catch a whiff of burnt plastic from whatever implements were in contact with the surface.\u000a\u000aForget the gun, then. You pull out your grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, you rear back with the grappling hook and give the pod a vicious swing. The hook scrapes across the glass, a hair-raising sound that runs a shiver down your back. The pod didn't crack, but the deep gouges from the hook give you enough hope to take a second swing.\u000a\u000aThis time, one barb catches in the glass. When you yank the hook loose, the yellowish gel inside the pod burbles, and a few drops dribble out of the hole like sticky tears. One more swing \u2013 and the hook pierces the pod like an ice pick.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5E.2]]</div>

You manage to nab the vial just before it hits the floor, and you take a second to look at this tiny, sticky tube that has caused so much trouble.\u000a\u000aThen your leg explodes into pain. The back of your knee burns like it's on fire, and the pain sears up your thigh and down your calf, so intense it cripples you. You slump against the wall, struggling to shove the vial into your belt pouch so you can hold onto the counter with both hands. \u000a\u000aThe pain from the laser shot doesn't recede \u2013 <i>won't recede</i>, you know \u2013 but you force yourself to push off the counter and hobble through the lab. You hiss every time you put weight on your leg and feel your chest tighten with pain and effort. The red-hot pain starts to blur into the red alarm lights blaring through the halls, and you cease to have thoughts, nothing in your mind now except the primal goal of getting <i>out</i>.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending1]]</div>

VBut the pod rattles unhappily in place, and you switch your attention to it. Despite your lack of verification, a release button has appeared at the base of the Chorobi pod. You slam the button, and the glass exterior of the pod hisses and sinks into the base. Yellow gel floods out of the container \u2013 and the vial with it \u2013 but you manage to snag the vial out of the goo just before it hits the floor.\u000a\u000aYou tuck the sticky vial into your belt pouch and turn, readying yourself for the onslaught of guards. You can see at least two dozen of them amassing behind the laboratory door. You unclip your stun gun and thumb the setting to machines, not humanoids. As the guards come swarming into the room, you fire above the guard's heads at the many-armed monstrosities in the middle of the room. \u000a\u000aElectricity overloads the huge machines, shocking them into erratic motion, their arms wheeling and jerking, slamming into guards, empty sample-slots whirring and shrieking. During the confusion, you fire a few more shots \u2013 at the lights above, at the rows of prototypes behind you, at the smaller machines on the work stations. \u000a\u000aBlinding bolts of lightning streak around the laboratory, and the whole room convulses as it comes to life. Lights and display screens shudder and spark; drawers rocket open and eject their contents onto the lab floor; the guards scramble around the room, dodging mechanical arms as they try to damage-control.\u000a\u000aYou dart through the chaos. The guards who do manage to grab you get their own electric shock, straight to the ribs. After shaking them loose, you escape the lab and slide down the hall toward freedom.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending2]]</div>

VThe glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods, and yellow liquid slops out of the ruined pod. It gives off a bizarre scent, like a hyper-sweet, fruit-flavored perfume that children would play around with. Scent aside, you don't feel inclined to touch it more than is necessary.\u000a\u000aThe vial slid out of the pod with the rest of the flood. Carefully, you pluck the vial out of the liquid and shake off as much goop as you can before storing it in your belt pouch.\u000a\u000aThe shattered pod didn't trigger any alarms, although the computer screen below the pods is flashing red alerts. You ignore it in favor of the other two pods. Arming yourself with your grappling hook again, you take two more swings at each pod \u2013 enough to fracture the surface of the glass without destroying the entire pod. <i>Should be enough to destabilize them</i>, you hope, without exposing yourself to more mystery liquids. \u000a\u000aThe computer has stopped flashing red. Now it displays a very simple message \u2013 <i>Lockdown initiated</i> \u2013 and a countdown timer rapidly approaching zero. That's your cue to leave.\u000a\u000aYou hightail it through the lab and out the door. As you skid to the other side, you hear the door crunch into lockdown mode behind you, and emergency lights flick on, bathing the lab in red. The alarm sirens start soon after, but by then you're already sprinting down the hall toward freedom.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending3]]</div>

VWhen most of the vial is exposed, you reach in and give it a tug. With an unhappy crackle, the vial finally comes loose of its icy containment. You brush some frost off the vial and take a moment to look at this tiny tube that's caused so much trouble \u2013 and could have caused far worse, if you hadn't succeeded at this mission. \u000a\u000aYou tuck the vial into your belt pouch and tap the release button again to reverse the process. The glass shield slides into place, obscuring the missing vial. Other than the swiftly melting liquid at your feet, you haven't left any trace of your actions.\u000a\u000aYour eyes linger on the other two pods. It would be easy to wreak havoc in this place, to destabilize the other pods, yank the specimens out of their drawers, trash the machines\u2026 But the temptation fades when you consider how elegantly you've completed your mission.\u000a\u000aYou step away from the wall, turn, and exit the lab, leaving it almost exactly the way you found it.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending4b]]</div>

VYou drag yourself back to your ship, stumbling through the sand, using your hands to haul your leg along the last stretch. Inside the ship, you collapse to the floor, the cold metal a shock to your burning leg. The pain threatens to black out your vision, but you remember your training and breathe slowly, counting the inhales and exhales until the worst of it recedes. \u000a\u000aThen you crawl across the floor to your medical supplies and down the first pain meds you can get your hands on. You haven't looked at your leg yet, and you won't, not until you're off this planet and safe. Medical treatment can wait.\u000a\u000aWith the pain meds taking the edge off, you manage to heave yourself into the pilot seat and activate the take-off sequence. \u000a\u000aYou don't know how long it will take you to recover from this injury, but you console yourself with the knowledge that the mission was a success. You can feel the weight of the Chorobi prototype resting securely in your belt pouch as you close your eyes and rise into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>
