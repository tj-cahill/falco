VAgent Reza lands her ship behind a sand dune, a short trek away from the laboratory. The sun was setting as she entered the planet's atmosphere, but it's still bright down here on the surface, where the shock-white sand holds its own glow. Sand is all she can see \u2013 without her team's coordinates, she would never have located the laboratory in the middle of this empty, forbidding desert. \u000a\u000aThis laboratory is one of several outposts built by the terrorist organization K.A.L. They appear to be using this location for storage of their most dangerous specimens, including the one Agent Reza was sent to retrieve \u2013 the Chorobi prototype. The Chorobi is a swarm of microscopic nanobots, machines so tiny that they can infiltrate any system without detection, including human bodies. Her team didn't give her the full details on what K.A.L. coded the nanobots to do, but based on K.A.L.'s past crimes, she can guess the outcome.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, K.A.L. released a self-replicating bacteria into the oceans of New Earth that destroyed the marine ecosystems and triggered a planet-wide environmental collapse. All of New Earth's inhabitants, including Reza and her family, were forced to abandon their ruined home. That's when she decided to join her current team, with the hope of one day tracking down K.A.L. and confronting them for their crimes.\u000a\u000aThis is <i>almost</i> that mission.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Setup.2]]</div>

VUnfortunately, her team ordered her to break in silently and complete the mission unnoticed. Her sole task is to retrieve the Chorobi prototype, nothing else. She spent the ride here reminding herself of that and trying to clear her mind. Upon landing, she moves through her ship on autopilot, suiting up and grabbing her gear the same way she does for every mission.\u000a\u000aBy the time she exits her ship, the sky is black and starless, although the sand still glows faintly underfoot as she heads around the dune and approaches the K.A.L. laboratory. It's a stark and ugly building \u2013 <i>not that I expected much else</i>, Reza thinks to herself. The concrete square of a building backs into a rocky outcropping, probably to protect it from the planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aAs Reza approaches, she scans the laboratory for entry points. Of course, she could enter through the front door, a massive metal contraption sealed shut by a security panel. Her team sent some old K.A.L. password to her decoder device, so she should be able to hack through the front door. \u000a\u000aAlternatively, she could head around the side of the building, where she knows there's a large hangar door for vehicles to deliver shipments under the protection of the outcropping. As long as there's no vehicle present, it should be easy to slip in. Or she could climb up to the roof and look for a sneakier way in, like a maintenance entrance that drops into the building.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[front door|Choice1A][$choice1 to "1A"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[hangar door|Choice1B][$choice1 to "1B"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[roof|Choice1C][$choice1 to "1C"]].</li>\u000a</ul>

VReza decides to enter through the front door.\u000a\u000aAfter all, her team provided her with a security code. <i>Might as well use it and reward their hard work</i>, she thinks. After jogging up to the front wall of the laboratory, she unclips her decoder from her belt and attaches the little box to the door's security panel. The box whirs to life, its display flickering with a blur of numbers too fast for her to read. All she cares about is the progress bar at the bottom, which fades from red to yellow to green. \u000a\u000aA small ding from the decoder is answered by a <i>clunk</i> within the door. The door's locking mechanisms groan and grind against each other as they twist open, and finally the two halves of the door shudder apart to grant her entrance. She wonders if it takes this much effort for the door to open every time. It sounds like it hasn't been used in weeks, so it's possible that the staff use a smaller entrance that her team doesn't know about.\u000a\u000aEither way, she's inside now. The sheer metal walls and corrugated floor resemble every other scientific facility she's been in. There are no visible cameras or sensors in the front hall, but she hurries around the corner anyway.\u000a\u000aShe's looking for a room to duck into and plan her next move \u2013 and right on time, she sights an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As she suspected, the door is unlocked, so she pushes it open and peeks inside. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1A.2]]</div>

VThe room contains some metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from the floor when she opened the door.\u000a\u000aReza ducks inside and shuts the door behind her. So far, so good \u2013 no alarm means that it's unlikely she was caught on a hidden sensor. She takes a minute to deactivate her decoder and secure it on her belt again; then she's ready to explore the building. Reza presses her ear to the door to verify that nothing has changed since she stepped in. Sounds clear, so she pushes it open and head out.\u000a\u000aShe's not two steps into the hall before she hears voices from around the corner \u2013 K.A.L. staff!

She could retreat into the storage room and leave the door cracked in order to hear more of the conversation. It sounds like they're discussing the nanobot security system: this could provide her with critical information on how to recover the prototype without setting off alarms.\u000a\u000aBut if she hides in the storage room now, she might end up trapped there for ages, listening to the K.A.L. staff whine about some irrelevant part of their work. There's no guarantee of good intel \u2013 and she wonders if she could stay quiet for that long in the presence of the villains she despises. \u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Hide in the storage room|Choice2A][$choice2 to "2A"]] and eavesdrop.</li>\u000a<li>[[Sneak down the hall|Choice2B][$choice2 to "2B"]] and move on.</li>\u000a</ul>

VReza decides to enter through the hangar.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, she easily identifies the huge hangar door. It extends halfway up the building, but right now the door is partially closed, only tall enough to admit trucks and other commercial vehicles. One such truck is sitting in the hangar bay with its rear doors open and half of its shipment unpacked. She ducks inside the far end of the hangar and wedges herself behind a work bench to observe the situation.\u000a\u000aAs she expected, she soon witnesses movement \u2013 a laborer trundles back to the truck, drags out another box, and carries it off to a storage room. She waits for one more cycle of delivery before she feels confident that she has enough time to move unnoticed. \u000a\u000aThe next time the laborer leaves with a box, Reza follows, creeping around benches and shelves and vehicle parts to get to the far wall of the hangar. She scans the wall and its many doors, all labeled with unhelpful identifiers like A-42 and D-16. <i>Guess we're leaving it to chance</i>, she tells herself, and yanks open the nearest door.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the hall appears empty. She doesn't test her luck by lingering; she darts down the hall and into the next one, hunting for a hiding spot. Right on time, she sights an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As she suspected, the door is unlocked, so she pushes it open and peeks inside.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1B.2]]</div>

VReza decides to enter through the roof.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, she unhooks her grapple-gun from her belt and aims it at the ledge. <i>Click\u2014zing!</i> The hook sings through the air, clatters onto the roof, and catches the edge with a solid clunk. She gives the hook a little tug to make sure it's secure and then clicks her gun again to reel in the slack. Once the wire is taut, she clambers up the building, hoists herself over the top, and hops onto the roof.\u000a\u000aIt looks clear: no movement on the roof except the billowing columns of steam that spew from the laboratory's exhaust vents. Reza picks her way around the foggy white pillars, eyes down, hunting for some kind of maintenance hatch \u2013 aha!\u000a\u000aShe notices the shine of a bright steel square amid the concrete. Crouching down, she grips the handle of the hatch and attempts to lift it \u2013\u000a\u000aAnd succeeds. She can't believe they left it unlocked. \u000a\u000aShe heaves the hatch open and peers inside. Looks like metal shelves, mostly bare, with some duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, shaken loose from the hatch when she wrenched it open.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1C.2]]</div>

Maybe the K.A.L. staff use this shelf the same way, in place of a real ladder \u2013 she shakes her head to interrupt that thought.

VThe chance to get information is worth the risk. \u000a\u000aReza ducks into the storage room, leaving the door cracked, and hides herself in a corner. If someone checks this room, she won't be concealed from sight, but she should have enough time for a surprise attack.\u000a\u000aThankfully, it doesn't sound like that will be necessary. Judging by the staff's footsteps, they haven't turned down this hall. There are about three of them, gossiping about the new security system installed in the inner laboratory.\u000a\u000aOne of them whines, "They couldn't have installed a slower unlock sequence on that door. I swear that even the buttons lag when I try to enter the code."\u000a\u000aMinor complaints aside, the group consensus is that the new system have been an improvement. The voices start to fade out of her hearing, so Reza creeps closer to the door and eases it open to catch some last comments. It seemed like her patience was not rewarded with any valuable information, until \u2013 \u000a\u000a"And they finally fixed the Glacior!" one of them says.\u000a\u000aReza isn't overly familiar with Glacior technology, but as she recalls, it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.\u000a\u000aThe staff member continues: "Every time I removed a prototype without the deep freeze, it felt like I was risking my life."\u000a\u000aThe others laugh, but say, "You <i>were</i>."\u000a\u000aFinally some decent information: low temperatures make the nanobots safer to handle. Reza waits until the staff's footsteps have faded, and then exits the room and proceeds down the hall. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2A.2]]</div>

She rounds the corner and plants her back against the wall. It sounds like she's all clear: the staff has carried on with their chitchat, ignorant of her presence.\u000a\u000aNow one of the scientists is complaining about the lag of the laboratory's new unlock mechanism. <i>Made the right choice on this one</i>, she thinks to herself. <i>Locking myself into that storage room would have been a huge waste of time.</i>\u000a\u000aAs she completes that thought and straightens up from the wall, she can't help but hear one more remark from the staff: "And they finally fixed the Glacior!" \u000a\u000aReza isn't overly familiar with Glacior technology, but, as she recalls, it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.

VReza decides to take advantage of the element of surprise and attack the guard.\u000a\u000aShe unsnaps the stun gun from her belt and fires at full blast. A bolt of electricity surges down the hall, and for a moment, everything is painted with a blinding white light. Then the bolt hits the guard squarely in its armor.

VReza decides that the simplest approach is to act like she belongs here.\u000a\u000aRelaxing her shoulders, she strolls down the hall without paying the Bovem any mind.

"I was told to go over to C and check on the filtration system."\u000a\u000aSlowly the guard looks her over, its attention lingering at her belt full of gadgets. She opens her mouth to convince the guard that this is a welding gun, not anything else, but it speaks first.\u000a\u000a"Told by who?"\u000a\u000a"My boss."\u000a\u000a"By," the guard growls, "who?"\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem howls, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio.

VNo time for mistakes.\u000a\u000aReza rushes to the door and slams her decoder onto the security panel. As soon as the decoder's screen lights up, she turns away from it. She has faith in the decoder's ability to do the hack, but needs to buy it some time.\u000a\u000aShe whips out her stun gun and takes wild shots down the hall, trying to bounce the electric shots off the wall and around the corner at the horde of approaching guards. Between sizzles of electric shots, she hears a soft <i>ding</i> from the decoder \u2013 door unlocked.\u000a\u000aShe snatches the decoder off the wall and back through the opening door. Once inside, the first thing she does is hit the button to close and relock the door. Then she reattaches her gadgets to her belt and quickly takes stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers. Various machines and tools are dotted across the stations \u2013 microscopes, spectrometers, and dozens of others whose names she doesn't know. \u000a\u000aTwo massive machines dominate the center of the room. Easily twice her height, the machines are hooked with numerous mechanical arms that rotate around a pillar of empty slots, hungry for biological samples. She doesn't spend much time examining the machines; she's here for the prototype.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice4A.2]]</div>

VNo time for stealth.\u000a\u000aReza slaps two explosive charges on a window, crouches, covers her head, and detonates the bombs. The first explosion crunches into the glass, leaving a crater like a giant took a bite out of it. The window doesn't break until the second charge explodes; then it shatters open with a terrific bone-cracking noise and a spray of glass shards.\u000a\u000aShe launches herself through the broken window and rolls to her feet on the other side. Shaking glass off her shoulders, she quickly takes stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers.

VNo time for pride.\u000a\u000aReza kicks in the grate covering the vent and drops onto her stomach. She manages to worm her way into the vent; it's barely wide enough for her shoulders, and the gadgets around her waist only makes the situation worse. They scrape against the soft metal of the vent shaft and, based on the noises, leave deep gouges as they go. No worse than the gouges in her shoulders \u2013 the sharp edge where one section of vent connects to the next cuts into her shoulders every time she squeezes past one.\u000a\u000aBut she reaches the other side, punches through another grate, and claws her way out. She pulls herself to her feet and quickly takes stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers.

VEven with guards closing in on her, it's critical to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aAs she skims the list of commands, searching for an "unlock" or "release," a different command catches her eye: <i>Initiate Glacior sequence</i>. Wasn't that the deep-freeze process that the scientist mentioned in the hallway?\u000a\u000aShe hits the command on impulse. The yellow liquid inside the pod crystallizes, and then desaturates, its color fading to a dim ivory. With a ding, the computer announces that the vial is now ready for release \u2013 just in time. The guards have unlocked the lab door. She doesn't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aShe slams the release button at the base of the Chorobi pod. The glass shield hisses and sinks into the base to reveal a pillar of frozen gel. She plucks the vial out of it, just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside her.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders. That explains why she hasn't been incapacitated already.\u000a\u000aStashing the vial in her belt pouch, Reza turns on the guards. There are a good two dozen of them, but their caution grants her a considerable advantage. She doesn't care about preserving anything in this lab.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5A.2]]</div>

VWith the guards closing in on her, there's no time to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aReza abandons the computer console and readies her stun gun. She fires one shot at the pod \u2013 thankfully, she fired it from an angle, because the bolt reflects off the glass and strikes a random counter rather than hitting her full in the chest. Forget the gun; she pulls out her grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, she rears back with the grappling hook and gives the pod a vicious swing. The hook pierces the pod like an ice pick; instantly the glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods. And just in time \u2013 the guards have unlocked the lab door. She doesn't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room now, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aYellow gel slops out of the ruined pod, and the vial with it. She plucks it out just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside her.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders.

VReza makes a mad dash through the rest of the laboratory, dodging staff and guards alike. Outside, the desert sand sucks at her feet and scatters dust into her face; it feels like the planet itself is working for K.A.L., doing its best to prevent her escape.\u000a\u000aShe fights through the desert and clambers onto her ship, relieved to breathe clean air in the quiet sanctuary of her own quarters. But she can't rest long. Shaking sand out of her hair, she heads to the cockpit and drops into the pilot seat.\u000a\u000aDimly through the walls of the ship, she can hear little <i>pings</i> and <i>sizzles</i>. K.A.L. guards must have caught up with her. She ignores their harmless shots and activates the take-off sequence. \u000a\u000aRelaxing in her chair, she pats the belt pouch at her side to feel the reassuring weight of the Chorobi prototype. The mission succeeded, even with the activated alarm. She wasn't injured by the guards, and K.A.L. doesn't have any idea who she is, so she has half a mind not to tell her team about the alarm at all.\u000a\u000aEither way, that's a future concern. For now, Reza takes a well-deserved rest, closes her eyes, and rises into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>
