VReza lands her ship behind a sand dune, a short trek away from the laboratory. The sun was setting as she entered the planet's atmosphere, but it's still bright down here on the surface, where the shock-white sand holds its own glow. Sand is all she can see \u2013 without her team's coordinates, she would never have located the laboratory in the middle of this empty, forbidding desert. \u000a\u000aThis laboratory is one of several outposts built by the terrorist organization K.A.L. They appear to be using this location for storage of their most dangerous specimens, including the one she was sent to retrieve \u2013 the Chorobi prototype. The Chorobi is a swarm of microscopic nanobots, machines so tiny that they can infiltrate any system without detection, including human bodies. Her team didn't give her the full details on what K.A.L. coded the nanobots to do, but based on K.A.L.'s past crimes, she can guess the outcome.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, K.A.L. released a self-replicating bacteria into the oceans of New Earth that destroyed the marine ecosystems and triggered a planet-wide environmental collapse. All of New Earth's inhabitants, including Reza and her family, were forced to abandon their ruined home. That's when she decided to join her current team, with the hope of one day tracking down K.A.L. and confronting them for their crimes.\u000a\u000aThis is <i>almost</i> that mission.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Setup.2]]</div>

VUnfortunately, Reza's team ordered her to break in silently and complete the mission unnoticed. Her sole task is to retrieve the Chorobi prototype, nothing else. She spent the ride here reminding herself of that and trying to clear her mind. Now that she's landed, she operates on autopilot, suiting up and grabbing her gear the same way she does for every mission.\u000a\u000aBy the time Reza exits her ship, the sky is black and starless, although the sand still glows faintly underfoot as she heads around the dune and approach the K.A.L. laboratory. It's a stark and ugly building \u2013 <i>not that I expected much else</i>, she thinks to herself. The concrete square of a building backs into a rocky outcropping, probably to protect it from the planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aAs she approaches the laboratory, she scans it for entry points. Of course, she could enter through the front door, a massive metal contraption sealed shut by a security panel. Her team sent some old K.A.L. password to her decoder device, so she should be able to hack through the front door. \u000a\u000aAlternatively, she could head around the side of the building, where she knows there's a large hangar door for vehicles to deliver shipments under the protection of the outcropping. As long as there's no vehicle present, it should be easy to slip in. Or she could climb up to the roof and look for a sneakier way in, like a maintenance entrance that drops into the building.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[front door|Choice1A][$choice1 to "1A"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[hangar door|Choice1B][$choice1 to "1B"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[roof|Choice1C][$choice1 to "1C"]].</li>\u000a</ul>

VReza decides to enter through the hangar.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, she easily identifies the huge hangar door. It extends halfway up the building, but right now the door is partially closed, only tall enough to admit trucks and other commercial vehicles. One such truck is sitting in the hangar bay with its rear doors open and half of its shipment unpacked. She ducks inside the far end of the hangar and wedge herself behind a work bench to observe the situation.\u000a\u000aAs she expected, she soon witnesses movement \u2013 a laborer trundles back to the truck, drags out another box, and carries it off to a storage room. She waits for one more cycle of delivery before she feels confident that she has enough time to move unnoticed. \u000a\u000aThe next time the laborer leaves with a box, Reza follows, creeping around benches and shelves and vehicle parts to get to the far wall of the hangar. She scans the wall and its many doors, all labeled with unhelpful identifiers like A-42 and D-16. <i>Guess we're leaving it to chance</i>, she tells herself, and yank open the nearest door.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the hall appears empty. She doesn't test her luck by lingering; she darts down the hall and into the next one, hunting for a hiding spot. Right on time, she sights an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As she suspected, the door is unlocked, so she pushes it open and peeks inside.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1B.2]]</div>

VReza decides to enter through the roof.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the laboratory, she unhooks her grapple-gun from her belt and aims it at the ledge. <i>Click\u2014zing!</i> The hook sings through the air, clatters onto the roof, and catches the edge with a solid clunk. She gives the hook a little tug to make sure it's secure and then clicks her gun again to reel in the slack. Once the wire is taut, she clambers up the building, hoists herself over the top, and hops onto the roof.\u000a\u000aShe holds still for a second, hidden in a crouch at the edge of the roof. There's a surprising amount of movement here, although none of it, as far as she can tell, from living things. Thick pillars of steam billow out of exhaust vents, and something past them is spinning, flashing dimly in the night. As she picks her way through the steam, she realizes that it is several somethings \u2013 a half dozen wind turbines mounted to the far end of the roof.\u000a\u000aThe turbines are small, not much taller than herself, and each is wired to a large battery box that sits behind it. In the relative calm of dusk, only a couple of the turbines are rotating; the rest stand still, nothing more than strange white stalks growing out of the concrete. During the daytime, the turbines must generate a significant amount of energy for K.A.L. \u2013 and Reza can only imagine how much energy is produced during one of this planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aShe crouches down to examine one of the battery boxes. Unclipping a multitool from her belt, she unscrews the box lid and throws it open. As expected, a familiar tangle of wires greets her. Her training included basic electrician work to cover situations like this. Opening the battery box only confirmed that it would be easy for her to sabotage this energy system, if she decided to do so.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1C.2]]</div>

VReza decides to enter through the front door.\u000a\u000aAfter all, her team provided her with a security code. <i>Might as well use it and reward their hard work</i>, she thinks. After jogging up to the front wall of the laboratory, she unclips her decoder from her belt and attach the little box to the door's security panel. The box whirs to life, its display flickering with a blur of numbers too fast for her to read. All she cares about is the progress bar at the bottom, which fades from red to yellow to green. \u000a\u000aA small <i>ding</i> from the decoder is answered by a <i>clunk</i> within the door. The door's locking mechanisms groan and grind against each other as they twist open, and finally the two halves of the door shudder apart to grant her entrance. She wonders if it takes this much effort for the door to open every time. It sounds like it hasn't been used in weeks, so it's possible that the staff use a smaller entrance that her team doesn't know about.\u000a\u000aEither way, she's inside now. The sheer metal walls and corrugated floor resemble every other scientific facility she's been in. There are no visible cameras or sensors in the front hall, but she hurries around the corner anyway.\u000a\u000aShe's looking for a room to duck into and plan her next move \u2013 and right on time, she sights an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As she suspected, the door is unlocked, so she pushes it open and peeks inside. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1A.2]]</div>

VIt contains some metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from the floor when she opened the door.\u000a\u000aShe ducks inside and shuts the door behind her. So far, so good \u2013 no alarm means that it's unlikely she was caught on a hidden sensor. She takes a minute to deactivate her decoder and secure it on her belt again; then she's ready to explore the building. She presses her ear to the door to verify that nothing has changed since she stepped in. Sounds clear, so she pushes it open and heads out.\u000a\u000aShe's not two steps into the hall before she hears voices from around the corner \u2013 K.A.L. staff!

VThe small chance that she might get decent information isn't worth the time.\u000a\u000aReza leaves the room behind and scampers down the hall, concentrated on getting out of sight as soon as possible. She rounds the corner and plants her back against the wall. At first, it sounds like she's all clear: the staff has carried on with their chitchat, ignorant of her presence.\u000a\u000aBut as she creeps down the hall, her ears catch onto bad news. The staff's voices have only grown louder, their footsteps closer. They must have turned down the hall she just left. Reza quickly scans her surroundings for anything of use, but the hall stretches mercilessly long and devoid of doors. \u000a\u000a<i>No choice but to run</i>, she decides. The noise might attract some attention, but the sight of her will attract more. So she scampers down the hall, trying her best to land on the balls of her feet. Her feet still slap painfully loudly against the metal, and as soon as she gets around the corner, she pulls herself to a halt.\u000a\u000aTo her right, she can hear an even louder commotion than what she just made. A glimpse of open double doors suggests a lounge or cafeteria, thick with chattering people. She avoids that and turns left. \u000a\u000aShe doesn't have an exact sense of where to go, but she suspects that the staff might have exited the inner lab just before she encountered them. Betting on that, she does her best to make a loop of the halls and circle back to the direction that the staff came from.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2B.2]]</div>

VThe chance to get information is worth the risk. \u000aThe chance to get information is worth the risk. \u000a\u000aReza ducks into the storage room, leaving the door cracked, and hides herself in a corner. If someone checks this room, she won't be concealed from sight, but she should have enough time for a surprise attack.\u000a\u000aThankfully, it doesn't sound like that will be necessary. Judging by the staff's footsteps, they haven't turned down this hall. There are about three of them, gossiping about the new security system installed in the inner laboratory.\u000a\u000aOne of them whines, "They couldn't have installed a slower unlock sequence on that door. I swear that even the buttons lag when I try to enter the code."\u000a\u000aMinor complaints aside, the group consensus is that the new system have been an improvement. The voices start to fade out of her hearing, so she creeps closer to the door and eases it open to catch some last comments. It seems like her patience won't be rewarded with any valuable information, until \u2013 \u000a\u000a"And they finally fixed the Glacior!" one of them says.\u000a\u000aReza isn't overly familiar with Glacior technology, but, as she recalls, it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.\u000a\u000aThe staff member continues: "Every time I removed a prototype without the deep freeze, it felt like I was risking my life."\u000a\u000aThe others laugh, but say, "You <i>were</i>."\u000a\u000aFinally some decent information: low temperatures make the nanobots safer to handle. Reza waits until the staff's footsteps have faded, and then exits the room and proceeds down the hall.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2A.2]]</div>

VThe real question is how soon K.A.L. would notice the sabotage. If a turbine malfunction immediately summoned a technician to the roof, her mission would be just as immediately compromised.\u000a\u000aAfter all, her team was very clear about her orders: acquire the Chorobi prototype, unnoticed and as quickly as possible. But they couldn't have anticipated this perfect opportunity to cripple K.A.L.'s work. \u000a\u000aWhat if the turbines powered the inner laboratory itself, where K.A.L. stores their specimens? A power outage could spoil or damage their carefully-preserved specimens, which would be as dangerous as it is satisfying to her personally. Then again, the turbines could generate nothing but backup power, in which case damaging them would be nothing but an annoyance to K.A.L.\u000a\u000aReza rises to her feet, scans the roof again, and consider hers options.

VReza decides that it's worth the risk \u2013 as long as she does it fast.\u000a\u000aWith more time, she would love to dismantle the turbines, strip off the blades, strip the screws, toss the pieces into the sand, and let the desert wind bear them away. As it is, time constrains her to a more utilitarian and less dramatic approach.\u000a\u000aShe targets the wired connection between the turbines and batteries. Flipping her multitool to its bladed function, she saws through the rubber hose protecting the wires and then <i>snip, snip, snip</i>. Even for six turbines, the process doesn't take more than a couple minutes total \u2013 and more importantly, she doesn't notice any sparks or alarms during that time. \u000a\u000aThe roof remains silent and empty. The turbines' blades continue to spin mildly in the breeze, unaware that they've been stripped of their purpose in life.\u000a\u000aAfter severing the connections, she follows the wires from the battery boxes back to their source, a central generator. As she had hoped, the generator sits conveniently near a maintenance hatch. She wrenches the hatch open and hops into the laboratory. \u000a\u000aThe hatch dumps me into what looks like a storage room \u2013 metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from when she pulled open the hatch. She reaches up and yanks the hatch shut after her, wincing at the resulting <i>clonk</i>. \u000a\u000aBut a peek outside the storage room indicates that no one was around to hear the noise. Feeling pleased with herself, she leaves the storage room behind and slides down the hall.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2C.2]]</div>\u000a

VReza can't risk the mission for the sake of her own personal satisfaction.\u000a\u000aShe leaves the turbines as they are \u2013 although they might still be useful to her in one way. If there is a maintenance hatch on the roof, it should be near the most important machine up here. She inspects the battery boxes again and find the wires trailing away from the boxes, toward a central generator. Exactly the map she needs.\u000a\u000aThe wires lead her directly to the generator. As it turns out, she could have found the generator while stumbling around blind because of the incredible amount of noise rattling off the thing. The generator is a brute of a machine, a massive shuddering mechanical engine block that's entirely out of place among the slender turbines and their neat lines of wires. \u000a\u000aSquinting through the noise, she circles the generator to locate her prize \u2013 a maintenance hatch, which she wrenches open at once, desperate to escape the clamor. She glances through the hatch only briefly; it's enough to see that the room below is dark, and probably unoccupied. \u000a\u000aThen she hops down, landing with a clatter on a metal shelf. Dust glimmers in the air around her, stirred up by the hatch. She's landed in what looks like a storage room \u2013 more metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. She reaches up and yanks the hatch shut after her, wincing at the resulting <i>clonk</i>. \u000a\u000aBut a peek outside the storage room indicates that no one was around to hear the noise. She'd rather not wait to see if anyone shows up, so she slides out of the room and down the hall.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice2D.2]]</div>

VShe doesn't have an exact sense of where to go, so she heads in roughly the same direction that the staff came from, with the hope that they exited the inner lab just before she encountered them. The environment supports her hunch: at the next intersection, the hall to her right has blue directional lights installed into the ceiling. She's seen similar lights in other facilities, where they served as part of a safety system that directed staff to a secure quarantine location in the case of a laboratory accident.\u000a\u000aFocused on the lights, Reza proceeds down the hall and turn the next corner without checking it \u2013 and of all corners, this was the wrong one to take blind. In the middle of the hall stands a hulking, armored Bovem. A local alien species, Bovem tower over humans in both height and weight, and their thick leathery skin, as grey and wrinkled as an elephant's, makes them ideal for guard duty. And much like elephants, Bovem are far from stupid.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem doesn't seem to have noticed her yet. It is stationed in front of a sealed door, its attention fixed on the wall opposite \u2013 or so she assumes. Its full-face helmet prevents her from knowing exactly where it's looking.\u000a\u000aShe pauses, deliberating on the best course action. Even with their natural armor, Bovem can be stunned and taken down, especially with the advantage of a surprise attack. She wouldn't mind injuring at least K.A.L. employee before she leaves here \u2013 but if she misjudges this and the Bovem wins the fight, she'll almost certainly be taken prisoner.\u000a\u000aAnd the guard might be a local forced to work for K.A.L. Maybe she should try to trick it instead, convince it that she's an employee too, a technician with all her gadgets hanging off her belt. Or she could sneak away, hoping that the Bovem doesn't notice the movement, and try to find a less dangerous route to the inner lab.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Attack|Choice3A][$choice3 to "3A"]] the guard.</li>\u000a<li>[[Trick|Choice3B][$choice3 to "3B"]] the guard.</li>\u000a<li>[[Sneak away|Choice3C][$choice3 to "3C"]] from the guard.</li>\u000a</ul>

VReza decides to take advantage of the element of surprise and attack the guard.\u000a\u000aShe unsnaps the stun gun from her belt and fires at full blast. A bolt of electricity surges down the hall, and for a moment, everything is painted with a blinding white light. Then the bolt hits the guard squarely in its armor. Her bullets and knives wouldn't have been able to cut through thick Bovem skin, but the electric bolt should affect the metal helmet and armor.\u000a\u000aKey word: <i>should</i>. Instead of scorching the armor and disabling its system, the electricity hits the guard, knocks it back one step, and does absolutely nothing else.\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem howls, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio. Instantly the blue ceiling lights flash to red, and unseen speakers shriek a high-pitched alarm. She sprints past the guard, who swipes at her \u2013 too slow \u2013 and shouts her escape route into the radio. \u000a\u000aShe skids around the corner and down the next hall. The overhead alarm is screeching so loudly that she almost misses the <i>thump-thump</i> of guards running in from her left. She scrambles right just in time, around another corner, and reaches a dead end.\u000a\u000aBut it's the <i>correct</i> dead end. A massive sheer steel wall, studded with thick-glassed viewing windows, stands between her and the inner laboratory. Beneath each window is a small grate to vent fumes, and centered in the middle of the wall is a hefty door and keypad.\u000a\u000aWith the guards storming down the hall behind her, Reza doesn't have much time to deliberate. She could try to hack the door in time, blast through one of the windows with explosives, or crawl in through a vent.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Hack the door.|Choice4A][$choice4 to "4A"]]</li>\u000a<li>[[Blast through a window.|Choice4B][$choice4 to "4B"]]</li>\u000a<li>[[Crawl through a vent.|Choice4C][$choice4 to "4C"]]</li>\u000a</ul>

VReza decides that the simplest approach is to act like she belongs here.\u000a\u000aRelaxing her shoulders, she strolls down the hall without paying the Bovem any mind. When it startles and orders her to halt, she looks at the Bovem with mild surprise.\u000a\u000a"For what? Isn't this Sector C?" she says, remembering a sign painted on the wall a couple halls back. "I was told to go over to C and check on the filtration system."\u000a\u000aSlowly the guard looks her over, its attention lingering at her belt full of gadgets. She opens her mouth to convince the guard that this is a welding gun, not anything else, but it speaks first.\u000a\u000a"Told by who?"\u000a\u000a"My boss."\u000a\u000a"By," the guard growls, "who?"\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aAt her hesitation, the Bovem yells, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio.

VReza decides that the best route is the safest one.\u000a\u000aShe creeps back a step, and then another, slipping around the corner and retreating the way she came. The Bovem doesn't follow, so she takes a second to breathe and reassess her plans. But not a moment later, a noisy group of K.A.L. employees come ambling out of <<if $choice2 is '2D'>>the cafeteria down the hall<<else>>a room down the hall<</if>>. They're chatting to each other, oblivious to her for now \u2013 but she takes the hint and leave the area.\u000a\u000aThe only available escape route leads her directly into a dead end, a small curved chamber with floor-to-ceiling windows of reinforced glass. More importantly, the chamber includes a large grate at foot level. It looks like it connects to a ventilation system that runs beneath the floor panels \u2013 and that is exactly what she needs to get out of K.A.L.'s sight for awhile.\u000a\u000aShe switches on the magnetic pulse in the soles of her boots and sets the charge to repel. With the magnet's added force, she kicks at the grate, and the metal flies backward without resistance, clattering down the tunnel it used to protect. Before anyone can investigate the noise, she slips through the hole and out of sight.\u000a\u000aShe drags herself through the tight quarters of the ventilation crawlspace, digging her toes into the corrugated metal to propel herself forward. She passes through a sweltering, pitch-black section \u2013 <i>must be crossing through a wall</i>, she guesses \u2013 and, on the other side, find herself beneath a floor panel. Heavy feet clatter overhead; the panel vibrates dangerously close to her face, but steadies out as the footsteps fade away.\u000a\u000aIn the following silence, she rolls over, pushes at the floor panel, and lifts it out of place. Another empty hall \u2013 perfect. She scampers out of the crawlspace and shifts the panel back into place. \u000a\u000aBrushing bits of dust and grime off her shoulders, she comes around a corner and meets with another dead end \u2013 but this one is the correct dead end. A massive sheer steel wall, studded with thick-glassed viewing windows, is all that stands between her and the inner laboratory. Beneath each window is a small grate to vent fumes, and centered in the middle of the wall is a hefty door and keypad.\u000a\u000aReza sees two equally good entry points. She could hack through the door, which will take a little extra time, or she could crawl through another tight vent to enter the lab.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Hack through the door.|Choice4D][$choice4 to "4D"]]</li>\u000a<li>[[Crawl through a vent.|Choice4E][$choice4 to "4E"]]</li>\u000a</ul>

VNo time for mistakes.\u000a\u000aReza rushes to the door and slam her decoder onto the security panel. As soon as the decoder's screen lights up, she turns away from it. She has full faith in the decoder's ability to do the hack, but she needs to buy it some time.\u000a\u000aShe whips out her stun gun and takes wild shots down the hall, trying to bounce the electric shots off the wall and around the corner at the horde of approaching guards. Between sizzles of electric shots, she hears a soft <i>ding</i> from the decoder \u2013 door unlocked.\u000a\u000aShe snatches the decoder off the wall and backs through the opening door. Once inside, the first thing she does is hit the button to close and relock the door. Then she reattaches her gadgets to her belt and quickly take stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers. Various machines and tools are dotted across the stations \u2013 microscopes, spectrometers, and dozens of others whose names she doesn't know. \u000a\u000aTwo massive machines dominate the center of the room.

VNo time for stealth.\u000a\u000aReza slaps two explosive charges on a window, crouches, covers her head, and detonates the bombs. The first explosion crunches into the glass, leaving a crater like a giant took a bite out of it. The window doesn't break until the second charge explodes; then it shatters open with a terrific bone-cracking noise and a spray of glass shards.\u000a\u000aShe launches herself through the broken window and rolls to her feet on the other side.

She keeps a watch on the halls behind her for any passing guard patrol and await the happy <i>ding</i> of a finished hack.\u000a\u000aThe laboratory door glides open with a surprisingly gentle swish, given its size.

VShe heads to the back of the lab. The back wall resembles an aisle of a server room, with rows and rows of narrow black boxes monitored by blinking blue lights. Searching every storage unit for the Chorobi prototype would be impossible, but she realizes her task is much simpler.\u000a\u000aA portion of the wall is recessed: it hosts three tall pods filled with a gelatinous yellow liquid. Inside each, suspended safely in the gel, floats a vial no larger than her hand. She has no proof that one of these holds the prototype; at the same time, she has absolutely no doubts.\u000a\u000aShe dashes to the computer console set below the pods. At her touch, the screen comes to life and immediately confirms her hunch: Pod #1, Chorobi. The screen also provides an overwhelming amount of details \u2013 the pod's current temperature, acidity, viscosity \u2013 none of which she has time to read. Tapping on the icon for Pod #1 supplies her with a dizzyingly long list of command options.\u000a\u000aReza has to decide now whether she'll take the time to sort through the computer commands or risk smashing the pod to grab the prototype right away.\u000a<ul>\u000a<<if $choice2 is "2A">><li>[[Remove|Choice5F][$choice5 to "5F"]] the prototype through the computer.</li>\u000a\u005c<<else>><li>[[Remove|Choice5A][$choice5 to "5A"]] the prototype through the computer.</li><</if>>\u000a<li>[[Smash|Choice5B][$choice5 to "5B"]] the pod to get the prototype.</li>\u000a</ul>

VWith the guards closing in on her, there's no time to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aReza abandons the computer console and readies her stun gun. She fires one shot at the pod \u2013 thankfully, she fired it from an angle, because the bolt reflects off the glass and strikes a random counter rather than hitting her full in the chest. Forget the gun; she pulls out her grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, she rears back with the grappling hook and gives the pod a vicious swing. The hook pierces the pod like an ice pick. Instantly the glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods. And just in time \u2013 the guards have unlocked the lab door. She doesn't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room now, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aYellow gel slops out of the ruined pod, and the vial with it. She plucks it out just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside her.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders. That explains why she hasn't been incapacitated already.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5B.2]]</div>

VReza skims the list of commands and notices the word <i>Release</i> near the bottom. Without reading the rest of the line, she hits that command.\u000a\u000aThe screen bleeps angrily at her and blinks white before displaying an error message: <i>Initial unlock preparations not detected</i>. Before Reza can panic, the screen generates another line of text: <i>Override sequence?</i>\u000a\u000aThat's more like it. She taps rapidly on the affirmative option and glances over her shoulder at the worsening situation behind her. The guards have unlocked the lab door and started to enter, wary, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aWhen she looks back at the screen, the display has changed. Where she was tapping, there is now the record of a fingerprint scan \u2013 <i>my fingerprint</i>, she realizes \u2013 and the rest of the screen has dimmed to a dark red. She can barely read the black text that informs her that the override sequence has been triggered by unverified personnel. \u000a\u000aThe pod rattles unhappily; she switches her attention to it. Despite her lack of verification, a release button has appeared at the base of the Chorobi pod. She slams the button, and the glass exterior of the pod hisses and sinks into the base. Yellow gel floods out of the container \u2013 and the vial with it \u2013 but she manages to snag the vial out of the goo just before it hits the floor.\u000a\u000aJust in time.

VEven with guards closing in on her, it's critical to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aAs she skims the list of commands, searching for an <i>unlock</i> or <i>release</i>, a different command catches her eye: <i>Initiate Glacior sequence</i>.

VStriding over glass shards, she heads to the back of the lab. The back wall resembles an aisle of a server room, with rows and rows of narrow black boxes monitored by blinking blue lights. Searching every storage unit for the Chorobi prototype would be impossible, but she realizes her task is much simpler.\u000a\u000aA portion of the wall is recessed: it hosts three tall pods filled with a gelatinous yellow liquid.

She has no proof that one of these holds the prototype; at the same time, she has absolutely no doubts.\u000a\u000aShe dashes to the computer console set below the pods. At her touch, the screen comes to life and immediately confirms her hunch: Pod #1, Chorobi. The screen also provides an overwhelming amount of details \u2013 the pod's current temperature, acidity, viscosity \u2013 none of which she has time to read. Tapping on the icon for Pod #1 supplies her with a dizzyingly long list of command options.\u000a\u000aAs she tries to skim the list, she hears the remnants of the window shatter under the force of the guards' weapons. The head guard is barking commands, ordering the others to enter the lab through the destroyed window. In hindsight, leaving the guards an easy entrance might not have been the best approach.\u000a\u000aReza only has a second to decide what to do: she can take the time to sort through the computer commands, risk smashing the pod to grab the prototype right away, or fire at the guards to drive them back and give herself more time.\u000a<ul>\u000a<<if $choice2 is "2A">><li>[[Remove|Choice5F][$choice5 to "5F"]] the prototype through the computer.</li>\u000a\u005c<<else>><li>[[Remove|Choice5A][$choice5 to "5A"]] the prototype through the computer.</li><</if>>\u000a<li>[[Smash|Choice5B][$choice5 to "5B"]] the pod to get the prototype.</li>\u000a<li>[[Fire|Choice5C][$choice5 to "5C"]] at the guards.</li>\u000a</ul>

VShe has enough time to do this properly.\u000a\u000aReza skims through the list of commands, hunting for an <i>unlock</i> or <i>release</i> function. Near the bottom of the list, she notices one that looks promising \u2013 <i>Release sequence AA-18R with hyperaria support</i> \u2013 but before she can tap it, a different command catches her eye.\u000a\u000a<i>Initiate Glacior sequence</i>. Wasn't that the deep-freeze process that the scientist mentioned in the hallway?\u000a\u000aShe hits the Glacior command. Inside the pod, the yellow liquid crackles and begins to crystallize, millions of little ice particles spider-webbing through the container. As ice fogs the pod, the yellow gel desaturates, its color fading to a dim ivory. Finally the pod exhales a chilly puff of fog and, with a ding, the computer announces that the vial is now ready for release.\u000a\u000aReza hits the release button at the base of the Chorobi pod. The glass shield hisses and sinks into the base to reveal a pillar of frozen gel. She tries to pry the vial out of the pillar, but even through gloves, the frozen gel bites at her fingers. She unclips the grappling hook from her belt and use one of the barbs to carefully scrape the gel away, sending little flakes of ivory fluttering to the floor.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5G.2]]</div>

VReza skims the long list of commands and notices the word <i>Release</i> near the bottom. The rest of the line is unintelligible to her \u2013 <i>Release sequence AA-18R with hyperaria support</i> \u2013 but she doesn't see any other options that look better. Hoping for the best, she hits the release command.\u000a\u000aThe screen bleeps angrily at her and blinks white before displaying an error message: <i>Initial unlock preparations not detected</i>. Does that mean she needs to find this 'hyperaria support' before the pod will open? \u000a\u000aBefore she can test her theory, the screen generates another line of text: <i>Override sequence?</i>\u000a\u000aThat's more like it. She taps on the affirmative option and watches the screen\u2026 do nothing. She taps again, and a third time, with a glance over her shoulder to make sure she's still alone in the lab. \u000a\u000aWhen she looks back at the screen, the display has changed. Where she was tapping, there is now the record of a fingerprint scan \u2013 <i>my fingerprint</i>, she realizes. The rest of the screen has dimmed to a dark red. She can barely read the black text that informs her that the override sequence has been triggered by unverified personnel. \u000a\u000aThat's when the sirens go off.\u000a\u000aWhirling red lights flash on the ceiling, spinning the room into a crimson mess, and a shrill alarm screams the presence of an intruder.

VReza wants to get the prototype and leave, as quickly as possible.\u000a\u000aShe evaluates the Chorobi pod again. The glass exterior of the pod looks as thick as the laboratory windows. Not ideal to break through, but she doesn't see any weaker points to exploit. Circling to the side of the pod, she pulls out her stun gun and fires a test shot at the glass. \u000a\u000aFiring from an angle was the right choice \u2013 the bolt bounces off the glass and flies into a nearby counter. The metal counter crackles with energy, and she catches a whiff of burnt plastic from whatever implements were in contact with the surface.\u000a\u000aForget the gun, then. She pulls out her grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, she rears back with the grappling hook and give the pod a vicious swing. The hook scrapes across the glass, a hair-raising sound that runs a shiver down her back. The pod didn't crack, but the deep gouges from the hook give her enough hope to take a second swing.\u000a\u000aThis time, one barb catches in the glass. When she yanks the hook loose, the yellowish gel inside the pod burbles, and a few drops dribble out of the hole like sticky tears. One more swing \u2013 and the hook pierces the pod like an ice pick.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5E.2]]</div>

The hook pierces the pod like an ice pick. Instantly the glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods. \u000a\u000aYellow gel slops out of the ruined pod \u2013 and the vial with it. She manages to nab the vial just before it hits the floor, and she takes a second to look at this tiny, sticky tube that has caused so much trouble.\u000a\u000aThen her leg explodes into pain. The back of her knee burns like it's on fire, and the pain sears up her thigh and down her calf, so intense it cripples her. She slumps against the wall, struggling to shove the vial into her belt pouch so she can hold onto the counter with both hands. \u000a\u000aThe pain from the laser shot doesn't recede \u2013 <i>won't recede</i>, she knows \u2013 but she forces herself to push off the counter and hobble through the lab. She hisses every time she puts weight on her leg and feels her chest tighten with pain and effort. The red-hot pain starts to blur into the red alarm lights blaring through the halls, and she ceases to have thoughts, nothing in her mind now except the primal goal of getting <i>out</i>.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending1]]</div>

VBut the pod rattles unhappily in place, and she switches her attention to it. Despite her lack of verification, a release button has appeared at the base of the Chorobi pod. She slams the button, and the glass exterior of the pod hisses and sinks into the base. Yellow gel floods out of the container \u2013 and the vial with it \u2013 but she manages to snag the vial out of the goo just before it hits the floor.\u000a\u000aShe tucks the sticky vial into her belt pouch and turn, readying herself for the onslaught of guards. She can see at least two dozen of them amassing behind the laboratory door. She unclips her stun gun and thumbs the setting to machines, not humanoids. As the guards come swarming into the room, she fires above the guard's heads at the many-armed monstrosities in the middle of the room. \u000a\u000aElectricity overloads the huge machines, shocking them into erratic motion, their arms wheeling and jerking, slamming into guards, empty sample-slots whirring and shrieking. During the confusion, she fires a few more shots \u2013 at the lights above, at the rows of prototypes behind her, at the smaller machines on the work stations. \u000a\u000aBlinding bolts of lightning streak around the laboratory, and the whole room convulses as it comes to life. Lights and display screens shudder and spark; drawers rocket open and eject their contents onto the lab floor; the guards scramble around the room, dodging mechanical arms as they try to damage-control.\u000a\u000aReza darts through the chaos. The guards who do manage to grab her get their own electric shock, straight to the ribs. After shaking them loose, she escapes the lab and slide down the hall toward freedom.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending2]]</div>

VThe glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods, and yellow liquid slops out of the ruined pod. It gives off a bizarre scent, like a hyper-sweet, fruit-flavored perfume that children would play around with. Scent aside, she doesn't feel inclined to touch it more than is necessary.\u000a\u000aThe vial slid out of the pod with the rest of the flood. Carefully, she plucks the vial out of the liquid and shakes off as much goop as she can before storing it in her belt pouch.\u000a\u000aThe shattered pod didn't trigger any alarms, although the computer screen below the pods is flashing red alerts. She ignores it in favor of the other two pods. Arming herself with her grappling hook again, she takes two more swings at each pod \u2013 enough to fracture the surface of the glass without destroying the entire pod. Should be enough to destabilize them, she hopes, without exposing herself to more mystery liquids. \u000a\u000aThe computer has stopped flashing red. Now it displays a very simple message \u2013 <i>Lockdown initiated</i> \u2013 and a countdown timer rapidly approaching zero. That's her cue to leave.\u000a\u000aReza hightails it through the lab and out the door. As she skids to the other side, she hears the door crunch into lockdown mode behind her, and emergency lights flick on, bathing the lab in red. The alarm sirens start soon after, but by then she's already sprinting down the hall toward freedom.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending3]]</div>

VWhen most of the vial is exposed, she reaches in and give it a tug. With an unhappy crackle, the vial finally comes loose of its icy containment. She brushes some frost off the vial and takes a moment to look at this tiny tube that's caused so much trouble \u2013 and could have caused far worse, if she hadn't succeeded at this mission. \u000a\u000aShe tucks the vial into her belt pouch and taps the release button again to reverse the process. The glass shield slides into place, obscuring the missing vial. Other than the swiftly melting liquid at her feet, she hasn't left any trace of her actions.\u000a\u000aHer eyes linger on the other two pods. It would be easy to wreak havoc in this place, to destabilize the other pods, yank the specimens out of their drawers, trash the machines\u2026 But the temptation fades when she considers how elegantly she completed her mission.\u000a\u000aReza steps away from the wall, turns, and exits the lab, leaving it almost exactly the way she found it.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Ending4b]]</div>

VReza drags herself back to her ship, stumbling through the sand, using her hands to haul her leg along the last stretch. Inside the ship, she collapses to the floor, the cold metal a shock to her burning leg. The pain threatens to black out her vision, but she remembers her training and breathes slowly, counting the inhales and exhales until the worst of it recedes. \u000a\u000aThen she crawls across the floor to her medical supplies and downs the first pain meds she can get her hands on. She hasn't looked at her leg yet, and won't, not until she's off this planet and safe. Medical treatment can wait.\u000a\u000aWith the pain meds taking the edge off, she manages to heave herself into the pilot seat and activate the take-off sequence. \u000a\u000aShe doesn't know how long it will take her to recover from this injury, but she consoles herself with the knowledge that the mission was a success. She can feel the weight of the Chorobi prototype resting securely in her belt pouch as she closes her eyes and rises into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>

VReza makes a mad dash through the rest of the laboratory, dodging staff and guards alike. Outside, the desert sand sucks at her feet and scatters dust into her face; it feels like the planet itself is working for K.A.L., doing its best to prevent her escape.\u000a\u000aShe fights through the desert and clambers onto her ship, relieved to breathe clean air in the quiet sanctuary of her own quarters. But she can't rest long. Shaking sand out of her hair, she heads to the cockpit and drops into the pilot seat.\u000a\u000aDimly through the walls of the ship, she can hear little pings and sizzles. K.A.L. guards must have caught up with her.

The mission succeeded, although her team won't be thrilled at her messy method of extraction. K.A.L. has her fingerprints. It won't take them long to identify her and trace her back to her team \u2013 but that's a future concern. For now, Reza closes her eyes and rises into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>

VReza sneaks through the rest of the laboratory, flawlessly dodging staff and guards alike. Outside, the desert sand sucks at her feet and scatters dust into her face. It feels like the planet itself is working for K.A.L., irritated by the absolute success of her mission and doing its best to prevent her escape.\u000a\u000aShe trudges through the desert and clamber onto her ship, relieved to breathe clean air in the quiet sanctuary of her own quarters. Brushing sand off her shoulders, she heads to the cockpit and takes a triumphant seat in the pilot's chair. She activates the take-off sequence and feels the familiar hum of engines at the back of the ship.\u000a\u000aAs she leans back in her chair, she feels the Chorobi prototype prod her side. She pops open the pouch and removes the vial to have another look at it. Her team will be ecstatic about this \u2013 and even more impressed that she managed to slip in and out of the laboratory with hardly a trace.\u000a\u000aReza decides that she deserve a rest, so she puts her boots up on the counter, closes her eyes, and rises into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>
