VI land my ship behind a sand dune, a short trek away from the laboratory. The sun was setting as I entered this planet's atmosphere, but it's still bright down here on the surface, where the shock-white sand holds its own glow. Sand is all I can see \u2013 without my team's coordinates, I would never have located the laboratory in the middle of this empty, forbidding desert. \u000a\u000aThis laboratory is one of several outposts built by the terrorist organization K.A.L. They appear to be using this location for storage of their most dangerous specimens, including the one I was sent to retrieve \u2013 the Chorobi prototype. The Chorobi is a swarm of microscopic nanobots, machines so tiny that they can infiltrate any system without detection, including human bodies. My team didn't give me the full details on what K.A.L. coded the nanobots to do, but based on K.A.L.'s past crimes, I can guess the outcome.\u000a\u000aTen years ago, K.A.L. released a self-replicating bacteria into the oceans of New Earth that destroyed the marine ecosystems and triggered a planet-wide environmental collapse. All of New Earth's inhabitants, including me and my family, were forced to abandon their ruined home. That's when I decided to join my current team, with the hope of one day tracking down K.A.L. and confronting them for their crimes.\u000a\u000aThis is <i>almost</i> that mission.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Setup.2]]</div>

VUnfortunately, my team ordered me to break in silently and complete the mission unnoticed. My sole task is to retrieve the Chorobi prototype, nothing else. I spent the ride here reminding myself of that and trying to clear my mind. Now that I've landed, I operate on autopilot, suiting up and grabbing my gear the same way I do for every mission.\u000a\u000aBy the time I exit my ship, the sky is black and starless, although the sand still glows faintly underfoot as I head around the dune and approach the K.A.L. laboratory. It's a stark and ugly building \u2013 <i>not that I expected much else</i>, I think. The concrete square of a building backs into a rocky outcropping, probably to protect it from the planet's vicious sandstorms.\u000a\u000aAs I approach, I scan the laboratory for entry points. Of course, I could enter through the front door, a massive metal contraption sealed shut by a security panel. My team sent some old K.A.L. password to my decoder device, so I should be able to hack through the front door. \u000a\u000aAlternatively, I could head around the side of the building, where I know there's a large hangar door for vehicles to deliver shipments under the protection of the outcropping. As long as there's no vehicle present, it should be easy to slip in. Or I could climb up to the roof and look for a sneakier way in, like a maintenance entrance that drops into the building.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[front door|Choice1A][$choice1 to "1A"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[hangar door|Choice1B][$choice1 to "1B"]].</li>\u000a<li>Enter through the [[roof|Choice1C][$choice1 to "1C"]].</li>\u000a</ul>

VI decide to enter through the hangar.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, I easily identify the huge hangar door. It extends halfway up the building, but right now the door is partially closed, only tall enough to admit trucks and other commercial vehicles. One such truck is sitting in the hangar bay with its rear doors open and half of its shipment unpacked. I duck inside the far end of the hangar and wedge myself behind a work bench to observe the situation.\u000a\u000aAs I expected, I soon witness movement \u2013 a laborer trundles back to the truck, drags out another box, and carries it off to a storage room. I wait for one more cycle of delivery before I feel confident that I have enough time to move unnoticed. \u000a\u000aThe next time the laborer leaves with a box, I follow, creeping around benches and shelves and vehicle parts to get to the far wall of the hangar. I scan the wall and its many doors, all labeled with unhelpful identifiers like A-42 and D-16. <i>Guess we're leaving it to chance</i>, I tell myself, and yank open the nearest door.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the hall appears empty. I don't test my luck by lingering; I dart down the hall and into the next one, hunting for a hiding spot. Right on time, I sight an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As I suspected, the door is unlocked, so I push it open and peek inside.\u000a\u000aLooks like metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from the floor when I opened the door.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1B.2]]</div>

VI decide to enter through the roof.\u000a\u000aAfter heading around the side of the building, I unhook my grapple-gun from my belt and aim it at the ledge. <i>Click\u2014zing!</i> The hook sings through the air, clatters onto the roof, and catches the edge with a solid clunk. I give the hook a little tug to make sure it's secure and then click my gun again to reel in the slack. Once the wire is taut, I clamber up the building, hoist myself over the top, and hop onto the roof.\u000a\u000aIt looks clear: no movement on the roof except the billowing columns of steam that spew from the laboratory's exhaust vents. I pick my way around the foggy white pillars, eyes down, hunting for some kind of maintenance hatch \u2013 aha!\u000a\u000aI notice the shine of a bright steel square amid the concrete. Crouching down, I grip the handle of the hatch and attempt to lift it \u2013\u000a\u000aAnd succeed. I can't believe they left it unlocked. \u000a\u000aI heave the hatch open and peer inside. Looks like metal shelves, mostly bare, with some duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used.

VI decide to enter through the front door.\u000a\u000aAfter all, my team provided me with a security code. <i>Might as well use it and reward their hard work</i>, I think. After jogging up to the front wall of the laboratory, I unclip my decoder from my belt and attach the little box to the door's security panel. The box whirs to life, its display flickering with a blur of numbers too fast for me to read. All I care about is the progress bar at the bottom, which fades from red to yellow to green. \u000a\u000aA small <i>ding</i> from the decoder is answered by a <i>clunk</i> within the door. The door's locking mechanisms groan and grind against each other as they twist open, and finally the two halves of the door shudder apart to grant me entrance. I wonder if it takes this much effort for the door to open every time. It sounds like it hasn't been used in weeks, so it's possible that the staff use a smaller entrance that my team doesn't know about.\u000a\u000aEither way, I'm inside. The sheer metal walls and corrugated floor resemble every other scientific facility I've been in. I don't see any cameras or sensors in the front hall, but I hurry around the corner anyway.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for a room to duck into and plan my next move \u2013 and right on time, I sight an unassuming door, one with an old, manual doorknob. As I suspected, the door is unlocked, so I push it open and peek inside. \u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice1A.2]]</div>

VThe room contains some metal shelves, mostly bare, with duct pipes and foam insulation tossed in a corner. This must be a storage room, and not one well-used. Dust particles glimmer in the air, stirred up from the floor when I opened the door.\u000a\u000aI duck inside and shut the door behind me. So far, so good \u2013 no alarm means that it's unlikely I was caught on a hidden sensor. I take a minute to deactivate my decoder and secure it on my belt again; then I'm ready to explore the building. I press my ear to the door to verify that nothing has changed since I stepped in. Sounds clear, so I push it open and head out.\u000a\u000aI'm not two steps into the hall before I hear voices from around the corner \u2013 K.A.L. staff! I start to hurry down the hall, but then I overhear one of them saying, " \u2013 which is an improvement over the last system, but it's still not ideal for the prototypes \u2013 "\u000a\u000aI freeze in place, conflicted. I could retreat into the storage room and leave the door cracked in order to hear more of the conversation. It sounds like they're discussing the nanobot security system: this could provide me with critical information on how to recover the prototype without setting off alarms.\u000a\u000aBut if I hide in the storage room now, I might end up trapped there for ages, listening to the K.A.L. staff whine about some irrelevant part of their work. There's no guarantee of good intel \u2013 and I wonder if I could stay quiet for that long in the presence of villains I despise. \u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Hide in the storage room|Choice2A][$choice2 to "2A"]] and eavesdrop.</li>\u000a<li>[[Sneak down the hall|Choice2B][$choice2 to "2B"]] and move on.</li>\u000a</ul>

It sounds like I'm all clear: the staff has carried on with their chitchat, ignorant of my presence.\u000a\u000aNow one of the scientists is complaining about the lag of the laboratory's new unlock mechanism. <i>Made the right choice on this one</i>, I say to myself. <i>Locking myself into that storage room would have been a huge waste of time</i>.\u000a\u000aAs I complete that thought and straighten up from the wall, I can't help but hear one more remark from the staff: "And they finally fixed the Glacior!" \u000a\u000aI'm not overly familiar with Glacior technology, but I remember it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.

VThe chance to get information is worth the risk. \u000a\u000aI duck into the storage room, leaving the door cracked, and hide myself in a corner. If someone checks this room, I won't be concealed from sight, but I should have enough time for a surprise attack.\u000a\u000aThankfully, it doesn't sound like that will be necessary. Judging by the staff's footsteps, they haven't turned down this hall. There are about three of them, gossiping about the new security system installed in the inner laboratory.\u000a\u000aOne of them whines, "They couldn't have installed a slower unlock sequence on that door. I swear that even the buttons lag when I try to enter the code."\u000a\u000aMinor complaints aside, the group consensus is that the new system have been an improvement. The voices start to fade out of my hearing, so I creep closer to the door and ease it open to catch some last comments. It seemed like my patience was not rewarded with any valuable information, until \u2013 \u000a\u000a"And they finally fixed the Glacior!" one of them says.\u000a\u000aI'm not overly familiar with Glacior technology, but I remember it has something to do with freezing nanobots for long-term storage.\u000a\u000aThe staff member continues: "Every time I removed a prototype without the deep freeze, it felt like I was risking my life."\u000a\u000aThe others laugh, but say, "You <i>were</i>."\u000a\u000aFinally some decent information: low temperatures make the nanobots safer to handle.

VI don't have an exact sense of where to go, so I head in roughly the same direction that the staff came from. I'm hoping that they exited the inner lab just before I encountered them. The environment supports my hunch: at the next intersection, the hall to my right has blue directional lights installed into the ceiling. I've seen similar lights in other facilities, where they served as part of a safety system that directed staff to a secure quarantine location in the case of a laboratory accident.\u000a\u000aFocused on the lights, I proceed down the hall and turn the next corner without checking it \u2013 and of all corners, this was the wrong one to take blind. In the middle of the hall stands a hulking, armored Bovem. A local alien species, Bovem tower over humans in both height and weight, and their thick leathery skin, as grey and wrinkled as an elephant's, makes them ideal for guard duty. And much like elephants, Bovem are far from stupid.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem doesn't seem to have noticed me yet. It is stationed in front of a sealed door, its attention fixed on the wall opposite \u2013 or so I assume. Its full-face helmet prevents me from knowing exactly where it's looking.\u000a\u000aI pause, deliberating on the best course action. Even with their natural armor, Bovem can be stunned and taken down, especially with the advantage of a surprise attack. I wouldn't mind injuring at least K.A.L. employee before I leave here \u2013 but if I misjudge this and the Bovem wins the fight, I'll almost certainly be taken prisoner.\u000a\u000aAnd the guard might be a local forced to work for K.A.L. Maybe I should try to trick it instead, convince it that I'm an employee too, a technician with all my gadgets hanging off my belt.

VI decide to take advantage of the element of surprise and attack the guard.\u000a\u000aI unsnap the stun gun from my belt and fire at full blast. A bolt of electricity surges down the hall, and for a moment, everything is painted with a blinding white light. Then the bolt hits the guard squarely in its armor. My bullets and knives wouldn't have been able to cut through thick Bovem skin, but the electric bolt should affect the metal helmet and armor.\u000a\u000aKey word: <i>should</i>. Instead of scorching the armor and disabling its system, the electricity hits the guard, knocks it back one step, and does absolutely nothing else.\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aThe Bovem howls, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio. Instantly the blue ceiling lights flash to red, and unseen speakers shriek a high-pitched alarm. I sprint past the guard, who swipes at me \u2013 too slow \u2013 and shouts my escape route into the radio. \u000a\u000aI skid around the corner and down the next hall. The overhead alarm is screeching so loudly that I almost miss the <i>thump-thump</i> of guards running in from my left. I scramble right just in time, around another corner, and reach a dead end.\u000a\u000aBut it's the correct dead end. A massive sheer steel wall, studded with thick-glassed viewing windows, stands between me and the inner laboratory. Beneath each window is a small grate to vent fumes, and centered in the middle of the wall is a hefty door and keypad.\u000a\u000aWith the guards storming down the hall behind me, I don't have much time to deliberate.

VI decide that the simplest approach is to act like I belong here.\u000a\u000aRelaxing my shoulders, I stroll down the hall without paying the Bovem any mind. When it startles and orders me to halt, I look at the Bovem with mild surprise.\u000a\u000a"For what? Isn't this Sector C?" I say, remembering a sign painted on the wall a couple halls back. "I was told to go over to C and check on the filtration system."\u000a\u000aSlowly the guard looks me over, its attention lingering at my belt full of gadgets. I open my mouth to convince the guard that this is a <i>welding</i> gun, not anything else, but it speaks first.\u000a\u000a"Told by who?"\u000a\u000a"My boss."\u000a\u000a"By," the guard growls, "who?"\u000a\u000aThis was a mistake.\u000a\u000aAt my hesitation, the Bovem yells, "Intruder!" into its helmet radio.

VNo time for mistakes.\u000a\u000aI rush to the door and slam my decoder onto the security panel. As soon as the decoder's screen lights up, I turn away from it. I have faith in the decoder's ability to do the hack, but I need to buy it some time.\u000a\u000aI whip out my stun gun and take wild shots down the hall, trying to bounce the electric shots off the wall and around the corner at the horde of approaching guards. Between sizzles of electric shots, I hear a soft <i>ding</i> from the decoder \u2013 door unlocked.\u000a\u000aI snatch the decoder off the wall and back through the opening door. Once inside, the first thing I do is hit the button to close and relock the door. Then I reattach my gadgets to my belt and quickly take stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers. Various machines and tools are dotted across the stations \u2013 microscopes, spectrometers, and dozens of others whose names I don't know. \u000a\u000aTwo massive machines dominate the center of the room. Easily twice my height, the machines are hooked with numerous mechanical arms that rotate around a pillar of empty slots, hungry for biological samples.

VNo time for pride.\u000a\u000aI kick in the grate covering the vent and drop onto my stomach. I manage to worm my way into the vent; it's barely wide enough for my shoulders, and the gadgets around my waist only makes the situation worse. They scrape against the soft metal of the vent shaft and, based on the noises, leave deep gouges as they go. No worse than the gouges in my shoulders \u2013 the sharp edge where one section of vent connects to the next cuts into my shoulders every time I squeeze past one.\u000a\u000aBut I reach the other side, punch through another grate, and claw my way out. I pull myself to my feet and quickly take stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers. Various machines and tools are dotted across the stations \u2013 microscopes, spectrometers, and dozens of others whose names I don't know. \u000a\u000aTwo massive machines dominate the center of the room. Easily twice my height, the machines are hooked with numerous mechanical arms that rotate around a pillar of empty slots, hungry for biological samples. I don't spend much time examining the machines; I'm here for the prototype.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice4C.2]]</div>

VNo time for stealth.\u000a\u000aI slap two explosive charges on a window, crouch, cover my head, and detonate the bombs. The first explosion crunches into the glass, leaving a crater like a giant took a bite out of it. The window doesn't break until the second charge explodes; then it shatters open with a terrific bone-cracking noise and a spray of glass shards.\u000a\u000aI launch myself through the broken window and roll to my feet on the other side. Shaking glass off my shoulders, I quickly take stock of the lab. Work stations extend along both sides of the lab, shiny, antiseptic counters built on top of vacuum-sealed drawers.

VI head to the back of the lab. The back wall resembles an aisle of a server room, with rows and rows of narrow black boxes monitored by blinking blue lights. Searching every storage unit for the Chorobi prototype would be impossible, but I realize my task is much simpler.\u000a\u000aA portion of the wall is recessed: it hosts three tall pods filled with a gelatinous yellow liquid. Inside each, suspended safely in the gel, floats a vial no larger than my hand. I have no proof that one of these holds the prototype; at the same time, I have absolutely no doubts.\u000a\u000aI rush to the computer console set below the pods. At my touch, the screen comes to life and immediately confirms my hunch: Pod #1, Chorobi. The screen also provides an overwhelming amount of details \u2013 the pod's current temperature, acidity, viscosity \u2013 none of which I have time to read. Tapping on the icon for Pod #1 supplies me with a dizzyingly long list of command options.\u000a\u000aI have to decide now whether to remove the prototype through the proper computer commands or risk smashing the pod to grab the prototype right away.\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>[[Remove the prototype through the computer.|Choice5A][$choice5 to "5A"]]</li>\u000a<li>[[Smash the pod to get the prototype.|Choice5B][$choice5 to "5B"]]</li>\u000a</ul>

VWith the guards closing in on me, there's no time to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aI abandon the computer console and ready my stun gun. I fire one shot at the pod \u2013 thankfully, I fired it from an angle, because the bolt reflects off the glass and strikes a random counter rather than hitting me full in the chest. Forget the gun; I pull out my grappling hook.\u000a\u000aSetting one knee on the console to get close, I rear back with the grappling hook and give the pod a vicious swing. The hook pierces the pod like an ice pick; instantly the glass splinters, shards sent flying into the other pods. And just in time \u2013 the guards have unlocked the lab door. I don't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room now, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aYellow gel slops out of the ruined pod, and the vial with it. I pluck it out just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside me.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders. That explains why I haven't been incapacitated already.\u000a\u000aStashing the vial in my belt pouch, I turn on the guards. There are a good two dozen of them, but their caution grants me a considerable advantage. I don't care about preserving anything in this lab.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Choice5B.2]]</div>

VEven with guards closing in on me, it's critical to extract the nanobots properly.\u000a\u000aAs I skim the list of commands, searching for an "unlock" or "release," a different command catches my eye: <i>Initiate Glacior sequence</i>. Wasn't that the deep-freeze process that the scientist mentioned in the hallway?\u000a\u000aI hit the command on impulse. The yellow liquid inside the pod crystallizes, and then desaturates, its color fading to a dim ivory. With a ding, the computer announces that the vial is now ready for release \u2013 just in time. The guards have unlocked the lab door. I don't need to look back to know they're streaming into the room, weapons raised.\u000a\u000aI slam the release button at the base of the Chorobi pod. The glass shield hisses and sinks into the base to reveal a pillar of frozen gel. I pluck the vial out of it, just as a laser shot pings off the wall beside me.\u000a\u000a"Don't fire at the pods!" a guard orders. That explains why I haven't been incapacitated already.\u000a\u000aStashing the vial in my belt pouch, I turn on the guards.

VI make a mad dash through the rest of the laboratory, dodging staff and guards alike. Outside, the desert sand sucks at my feet and scatters dust into my face; it feels like the planet itself is working for K.A.L., doing its best to prevent my escape.\u000a\u000aI fight through the desert and clamber onto my ship, relieved to breathe clean air in the quiet sanctuary of my own quarters. But I can't rest long. Shaking sand out of my hair, I head to the cockpit and drop into the pilot seat.\u000a\u000aDimly through the walls of the ship, I can hear little <i>pings</i> and <i>sizzles</i>. K.A.L. guards must have caught up with me. I ignore their harmless shots and activate the take-off sequence. \u000a\u000aRelaxing in my chair, I pat the belt pouch at my side to feel the reassuring weight of the Chorobi prototype. The mission succeeded, even with the activated alarm. I wasn't injured by the guards, and K.A.L. doesn't have any idea who I am, so I have half a mind not to tell my team about the alarm at all.\u000a\u000aEither way, that's a future concern. For now, I take a well-deserved rest, close my eyes, and rise into the planet's atmosphere.\u000a\u000a<div id="next">[img[Next page|arrow][Return]]</div>
